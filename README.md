Step 1: Download the MySQL JDBC Driver

    Visit the official MySQL Connector/J download page: MySQL Connector/J Downloads.
    Download the latest version of the MySQL JDBC driver (a JAR file). Choose the platform-independent version.

Step 2: Add the MySQL JDBC Driver to Your Project
Option 1: Using an IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans):

    Open your Java project in your preferred IDE.

    Create a new "lib" directory in your project (if it doesn't already exist).

    Copy the downloaded MySQL JDBC driver JAR file into the "lib" directory.

    Right-click on the JAR file in the IDE, and select "Build Path" > "Add to Build Path" or a similar option depending on your IDE.
