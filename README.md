# EffortLogger2-Honors
Extending the work my team did for the CSE 360 EffortLogger2 project to meet the honors project criteria.

You will need to download MySQL and most likely the MySQL Workbench(I'm sure there are other programs, but that is what I used).
Once that is done I have the commands to generate the database I've been working with in the "dump" folder.
Create your user credentials with Username: "root", Password: "qh93gxV%k!8nzheQaAK"
if you don't use those exactly you will have to change every instance of the code accessing MySQL with your own credentials.

Step 1: Download the MySQL JDBC Driver

    Visit the official MySQL Connector/J download page: MySQL Connector/J Downloads.
    Download the latest version of the MySQL JDBC driver (a JAR file). Choose the platform-independent version.

Step 2: Add the MySQL JDBC Driver to Your Project
Option 1: Using an IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans):

    Open your Java project in your preferred IDE.

    Create a new "lib" directory in your project (if it doesn't already exist).

    Copy the downloaded MySQL JDBC driver JAR file into the "lib" directory.

    Right-click on the JAR file in the IDE, and select "Build Path" > "Add to Build Path" or a similar option depending on your IDE.
